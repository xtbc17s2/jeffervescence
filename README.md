## Day 3 Homework

* Store the flicks/dinosaurs in an array, as well as in the DOM.

### Mega Bonus Credit

* Add a promote/fav button, just like you did yesterday!
* Add a delete button, just like yesterday!

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Add buttons to move a flick/dinosaur up and down the list.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Persist the flicks/dinosaurs data using `window.localStorage`.  The flicks/dinosaurs should stay in the list even when the page is refreshed.

## Day 4 Homework

* Fix the issue with flick id values, which sometimes results in removing the wrong flick from the array (and thus from localStorage).

### Bonus Credit

* Also track the year the flick was released.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Edit the names of flicks that are already in the list (and make sure the changes persist across page loads). Gee, it would nice if we could make that span's _content editable_ somehow.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Have a good weekend.
