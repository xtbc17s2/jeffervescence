## Day 3 Homework

* Store the flicks/dinosaurs in an array, as well as in the DOM.

### Mega Bonus Credit

* Add a promote/fav button, just like you did yesterday!
* Add a delete button, just like yesterday!

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Add buttons to move a flick/dinosaur up and down the list.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Persist the flicks/dinosaurs data using `window.localStorage`.  The flicks/dinosaurs should stay in the list even when the page is refreshed.

## Day 4 Homework

* Fix the issue with flick id values, which sometimes results in removing the wrong flick from the array (and thus from localStorage).

### Bonus Credit

* Also track the year the flick was released.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Edit the names of flicks that are already in the list (and make sure the changes persist across page loads). Gee, it would nice if we could make that span's _content editable_ somehow.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Have a good weekend.

## Day 5 Homework

Categorize stuff! Separate flicks into genres, or separate movies from TV shows! Make a whole new thing with categories, like messages separated into channels! Use your tremendous creativity! Exclamation point!

Or heck, just make separate lists based on the second input field you added in the weekend homework!

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

Add a search field, and only show the results that match the search criteria. Here are some things you may wish to use while implementing search:

* [`Array.prototype.find()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find?v=control) (very similar to `findIndex()`)
* [`HTMLElement.dataset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset) (remember those IDs we stored?)
* [`display: none`](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_display_visibility.asp) (Heck, you could add a class that includes this rule, and add and move that class from elements you wish to hide.)
